This copy of the data was collected manually by bradc on Aug 31-Sep 1
2018 against 4ab7699425 of chapel-lang/master within an exclusive
slurm partition on chapcs07 within
/ptmp/chapelu/release-over-release/chapel.  It is being archived here
for the purposes of splicing against nightly performance data.

A few notes on how the data was gathered this time:

* Starting the job at ~8:00am caused the job to only be partway
  through 1.17.1 at midnight the first day.  I re-ran testing for
  1.17.1 on day two.  Next time around, we may want to just comment
  out the 1.17.1 releases for the first day and the latter ones for
  the second to avoid getting double data for some 1.17.1 tests.

* Unfortunately, the nightly performance testing didn't successfully
  turn off my testing, so the two ran concurrently the first night
  while I was finishing up 1.17.1.  For this reason, I had to go back
  and edit out the original 1.17.1 numbers.  Worse, on the second
  day's run, I failed to set CHPL_TEST_PERF_DIR correctly, so ended up
  having to merge the two days' outputs (sigh...).

* For some reason, I lost my exclusive partition the morning of the
  first day for perhaps an hour or so.  I didn't check to see whether
  others were doing testing at the same time to see whether it
  impacted things.  Since it was during the oldest runs, I didn't feel
  that worried about things.

* We lost backwards compatibility due to...
  - delete-free class modifiers (owned, borrowed, unmanaged, etc.)

* This was run against gcc 6.3 as the back-end compiler.  Hoewver, the
  1.12 and 1.13.1 installations of chpl were built against gcc 6.2.
  Older versions of 'chpl' are built against older versions of gcc as
  they do not build cleanly against gcc >= 6.2.  (However, it is
  believed that the runtime and third-party libraries are less likely
  to have this limitation if someone wanted to rebuild them with a
  newer gcc in the future).
